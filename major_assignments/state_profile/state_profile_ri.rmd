## PPP State Profile

Your assignment is to explore a dataset of PPP loan applications for a particular state and to answer a series of questions that will help you summarize that state's loan applications. You will need to write R code to answer those questions. You also will bring in other data, including Census information, and you will be making graphics, including maps, to illustrate your findings.

The deliverable will be this R Markdown notebook and a data folder that you will receive with a state's loan application data. Place any other data you are using to answer the questions in the same data folder.

## Load libraries and establish settings

**Task** Create a codeblock and load appropriate packages and settings for this assignment.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(janitor)
library(tigris)
library(sf)
library(lubridate)
library("dplyr")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
#census_api_key("4803c902de03d46e9a781d90420e95f833c57d66", install=TRUE)
```

## Load the data:
```{r}
clean_ri_ppp_loans <- read_csv("DATA/clean_cities_rhode_island_ppp.csv")
```
## Initial Exploration

**Q1.**. Write R code that generates some basic descriptive statistics that allows you to describe the applications from your state. This code should produce results that describe the data in different ways: how many applications there are, along with ways to understand the typical and most frequent values for columns you find interesting or newsworthy. You should produce at least five (5) descriptive statistics and write up a summary of the data using them.

**A1.** 
##Overall, a total of 33,807 loans were disbursed to RI recipients, totaling $2,878,028,767. April of 2020 saw the most loans approved (12078), while August of 2020 saw the fewest (290). Most loans went to Providence county (19408), which also received the largest sum amount of loans ($1,730,824,186). On a city-by-city basis, Providence received the most (6,372), followed by Cranston (2,959) and Warwick (2758). COASTAL MEDICAL, INC. — a hospital system with locations around RI — received the most money ($,9048,600) and retained 500 jobs, but their demographic ownership data is unavailable. It is notable that none of the top-ten PPP-receiving companies in RI self-reported as being minority or female owned.

----------
##Q1.1: 
How many PPP loans were disbursed to RI recipients? What was the sum total disbursed?

**A total of 33,807 loans were disbursed to RI recipients, totaling $2,878,028,767.**


```{r}
clean_ri_ppp_loans %>% 
  summarize(
    count_loans = n(),
    total_loans_amount = sum(amount)
  )

```
##Q1.2: 
What cities received the most PPP loans?

**Providence received the most (6,372), followed by Cranston (2,959) and Warwick (2758).**
```{r}
clean_ri_ppp_loans %>% 
  group_by(clean_city) %>% 
   summarise(
    count=n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```

##Q1.3: 
What county received the most loans? What county received the highest sum of loans?

**Most loans went to Providence county (19408), which also received the largest sum amount of loans ($1,730,824,186)**
```{r}
ri_ppp_by_county <- clean_ri_ppp_loans %>% 
  group_by(project_county_name) %>% 
    summarise(
      count=n(),
      total_loans_county=sum(amount)) %>% 
arrange(desc(total_loans_county))
```

##Q1.4:
What month saw the most loans approved during the duration of the program? What month saw the fewest?

**April of 2020 saw the most loans approved (12078), while August of 2020 saw the fewest (290).**

```{r}
clean_ri_ppp_loans %>%
  mutate(Month = floor_date(date_approved, "month")) %>%
  group_by(Month) %>%
  summarise(total = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total))

```

##Q1.5:
What companies received the greatest loan amounts? What are their demographics? How many jobs did they retain?
**COASTAL MEDICAL, INC. received the most money ($,9048,600) and retained 500 jobs, but their demographic ownership data is unavailable. It is notable that none of the top-ten PPP-receiving companies in RI self-reported as being minority or female owned.**

```{r}
ri_ppp_company_info <- clean_ri_ppp_loans %>% 
  select(name, amount, gender, race, jobs_retained) %>% 
  arrange(desc(amount)) %>% 
  slice((1:10))
ri_ppp_company_info
```

## Geographic Analysis

**Q2.** Write R code that examines geographic patterns for PPP loans in your state, using Census population information to calculate a per-capita figure for the state and counties and zip codes. Then, make a county map using ggplot showing the per-capita data *and* a zip code map showing the difference from the statewide per-capita figure. Describe the most interesting or newsworthy findings based on your exploration.

**A2.** 

----------
**Q1: Calculate the per-capita figure for the state, counties and zip codes

**Load the RI population data
```{r}
ri_population <- get_acs(geography = "county", 
              variables = c(population = "B01001_001"), 
              state = "RI",
              geometry = TRUE)
```

**Calculate the per-capita figure for the state
##About $2,722.23 loans per capita, statewide 
```{r}
state_pop <- ri_population %>%
  summarise(
    state_pop = sum(estimate)
  ) 
state_pop

2878028767/1057231
```
**Calculate the per-capita figure per county
```{r}
county_pop <- ri_population %>% 
   mutate(county = str_to_upper(NAME)) %>% 
  mutate(county = case_when(
   county == "WASHINGTON COUNTY, RHODE ISLAND" ~ "WASHINGTON",
   county == "NEWPORT COUNTY, RHODE ISLAND" ~ "NEWPORT",
   county == "PROVIDENCE COUNTY, RHODE ISLAND" ~ "PROVIDENCE",
   county == "KENT COUNTY, RHODE ISLAND" ~ "KENT",
   county == "BRISTOL COUNTY, RHODE ISLAND" ~ "BRISTOL")) %>% 
  rename(project_county_name = county) %>% 
  select(project_county_name, estimate, GEOID, geometry)
```

```{r}
ppp_by_county <- ri_ppp_by_county  %>%
  left_join(county_pop, by=c("project_county_name")) %>% 
  mutate(per_capita_county = total_loans_county/estimate)
ppp_by_county
```

**Make a map showing the per-capita figures by county**
```{r}
counties <- counties() 
glimpse(counties)
```

```{r}
ri_counties <- counties %>%
  filter(STATEFP == "44")
ri_counties
```

```{r}
ri_counties %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf() + 
  theme_minimal()
```

**Calculate the per capita figures per zip code

```{r}
ri_ppp_zip <- clean_ri_ppp_loans %>% 
  mutate(zip = str_sub(zip, start=1L, end=5L)) %>%
  group_by(zip) %>% 
    summarise(
      count=n(),
      total_loans_county=sum(amount)) %>%

ri_ppp_by_zip
```

```{r}
ri_zip_population <- get_acs(geography = "zcta", variables = c(totalpopulation = "B02001_001"), year = 2019, state = "RI",
              geometry = TRUE) %>%

  mutate(per_capita_zip = total_loans_zip/estimate) %>% 

  arrange(desc(per_capita_zip))
zip_per_capita
```

##Join the zip_per_capita with geo data

```{r}
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data=ri_counties, aes(fill=ri_counties)) + 
  theme_minimal()


```
## Lender Analysis

**Q3.** Write R code to examine which lenders had the most approved applications in your state (and include summary statistics such as total amount and average loan amount). Generate dataframes that show the number and total amount of all loans and undisbursed loans per lender. For those lenders who had any undisbursed loans, make a graphic showing the relationship between the total amount of loans and the total undisbursed amount. Describe the most noticeable outlier lenders on that graphic below.

**A3.** 
Rhode Island did not have any undisbursed loans, so I made a couple of graphics to see what I noticed. Here are the top 5 lenders by total loaned (https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/xeNEe/1/), and the bottom five (https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TeXzN/1/). The results are not really surprising, with the major RI accounting for the greatest sum of loans disbursed. Although I did find it interesting that the Bank of Rhode Island's average loan amount is far higher than the Citizen's Bank average — and the data shows that it did so by loaning to fewer applicants. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/TopFive.png"))
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/BottomFive.png"))
```

**Average amount
```{r}
lender_amounts <- clean_ri_ppp_loans %>%
  group_by(lender) %>%
  summarise(
    count_loans = n(),
    sum_loans_approved = sum(amount),
    mean_loan_amount = mean(amount),
    median_loan_amount = median(amount)
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_loan_amount))

```

```{r}
lender_undisbursed <- clean_ri_ppp_loans %>% 
  filter(undisbursed_amount > 0) %>% 
  group_by(lender, undisbursed_amount) %>% 
  summarise(
    count_undisbursed = n(),
    sum_loans_undisbursed = sum(amount)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count_undisbursed))

```

```{r}
lender_stats_combined <- lender_amounts %>% 
  left_join(lender_undisbursed, by=c("lender")) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sum_loans_approved))


```

```{r}
top_five_graph_lender_stats <- lender_stats_combined %>% 
  select(lender, count_loans, mean_loan_amount, sum_loans_approved) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sum_loans_approved)) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```


```{r}
bottom_five_graph_lender_stats <- lender_stats_combined %>% 
  select(lender, count_loans, mean_loan_amount, sum_loans_approved) %>% 
  arrange((sum_loans_approved)) %>% 
  slice(1:5)
```


```{r}
write_csv(bottom_five_graph_lender_stats,"bottom_five_graph_lender_stats.csv")
```


```{r}
write_csv(top_five_graph_lender_stats,"top_five_graph_lender_stats.csv")

```

## Industry Analysis

**Q4.** Write R code that examines industry patterns for PPP loans in your state, using the NAICS codes from the PPP data as a starting point. Generate statewide and county industry totals, then join that with 2018-19 data from the [Census County Business Patterns survey](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/datasets/2019/cbp19co.zip) using 6-digit NAICS codes. The documentation explaining that data can be found here: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/technical-documentation/records-layouts/2018_record_layouts/county-layout-2018.txt. To do this, you will need to add FIPS codes to your PPP dataset.

Does the distribution of PPP applications by the top 10 industries (by number of applications) roughly match the number of businesses reported in the Census data? Does it roughly match if you remove self-employed individuals and sole proprietorships from the PPP totals? Write up a summary of what you've found and whether there are potentially newsworthy patterns in the data.

Create a county-level map showing the differences between the PPP applications and the Census business data for one of the top 10 industry codes. You can do this either using ggplot or Datawrapper (if the latter, publish that map and include the URL below).

## Summary

**Q5.** What is the most promising story idea that you have found during this exploration? How would you approach reporting it out and what other information/data would you need to do that? What would be the minimum story you could get from this, and what would be the maximum story?
